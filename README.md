### Key Features and Software Engineering Themes

## 1. Software Design Principles
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The game is built using a modular, class-based architecture
- **Low Coupling**: Each component (game logic, UI, API) operates independently
- **High Cohesion**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Clean Code**: Comprehensive documentation and consistent coding style

## 2. Event-Driven Programming
- **Event System**: Custom event system implementing the Observer pattern
- **UI Events**: Kivy-based event handling for user interactions
- **Game Events**: Decoupled communication between components through events
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking API calls and game state updates

## 3. Interoperability
- **Banana API Integration**: Seamless interaction with external API services
- **RESTful Communication**: Standard HTTP methods for API requests
- **Data Exchange**: JSON-based data transfer between systems
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures

## 4. Virtual Identity
- **User Authentication**: Secure local and API-based authentication
- **Profile Management**: Comprehensive user profile tracking
- **Session Handling**: Secure session management with expiration
- **Score Synchronization**: Bi-directional score syncing with Banana API

## Implementation Details

### Event System (`events.py`)
The event system implements the Observer pattern, allowing components to communicate without direct coupling:
```python
# Subscribe to events
event_system.subscribe(GameEvents.SCORE_UPDATED, on_score_update)

# Publish events
event_system.publish(GameEvents.SCORE_UPDATED, {'score': new_score})
```

### API Integration (`api_client.py`)
The Banana API client handles all external API communication:
```python
# Get puzzle from API
puzzle = api_client.get_puzzle(difficulty=5)

# Submit score to API
api_client.submit_score(user_id, score)
```

### Authentication Bridge (`auth_api_bridge.py`)
Bridges local authentication with the Banana API:
```python
# Login with API verification
profile, session = await auth_bridge.login(username, password)

# Sync scores with API
auth_bridge.sync_score(profile)
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
BANANA_API_KEY=your_api_key
BANANA_API_URL=https://api.banana.dev/v1
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```
